    "text": "My name is Ben Frizzell, and I am currently a graduate student at the UBC Master of Data Science (MDS) program. I started my studies with a bachelor’s degree in physics, but slowly my passion turned towards data science; I’m deeply passionate about creating mathematical models to understand the world, and data science seemed the best way to make a career out of these interests! I also am very passionate about music, so in the future I hope to work in some kind of career relating to Music Information Retrieval (MIR) so I can join these two passions together.\nAs the program progresses, I hope to display more of my projects on this website. Stay tuned for more soon!"
